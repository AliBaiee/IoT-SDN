This program used to reduce internet traffic by using the "SOM" algorithm, using Data-set that contains huge data.
We using Data Set UNSW-NB15 file name is training.csv and the file tcp.csv is only TCP traffic from UNSW-NB15
there is 6 code for training SOM model every code using different features

1-6_76.ipynb this code using all protocols with 6 features, for the label used 43 number features.

2-6_92_0&1.ipynb this code using all protocols with 6 features, for the label used 44 number features.

3-13_80_cat.ipynb this code using TCP protocols with 13 features, for the label used 44 number features.

4-13_80_0&1.ipynb this code using TCP protocols with 13 features, for the label used 43 number features.

5-Project-Ali3.ipynb this code using TCP protocols with 35 features, for the label used 44 number features.

6-SOM-Prediction.ipynb this code using TCP protocols with 35 features, for the label used 44 number features and prediction part.
